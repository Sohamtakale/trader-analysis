Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment Analysis Report
PART B — Analysis
Q1. Does performance (PnL, win rate, drawdown proxy) differ between Fear vs Greed days?
Answer:

Yes, trader performance varies significantly across sentiment regimes.

📊 Evidence — Average Daily PnL by Sentiment

Observations:

Fear sentiment produced the highest average daily profitability.

Greed sentiment produced moderate profitability.

Neutral sentiment showed the lowest profitability.

Win Rate Comparison

Although win rate differences are small:

Win rate is slightly higher during Greed.

However, Fear produces higher profitability overall.

This suggests that trade sizing and volatility exposure drive profitability more than trade accuracy.

Drawdown Proxy

Using cumulative PnL and rolling maximum as a drawdown proxy:

Fear periods show larger PnL swings (higher volatility).

Greed periods show more stable but smaller profit trajectories.

Interpretation:

Fear-driven markets introduce volatility, allowing traders to capture larger price movements, resulting in higher daily PnL despite similar win rates.

Q2. Do traders change behavior based on sentiment (trade frequency, leverage, long/short bias, position sizes)?
Answer:

Yes, traders modify their behaviour significantly across sentiment regimes.

📊 Evidence — Activity Segment Performance

Trade Frequency:

Traders execute more trades during Fear periods.

High activity traders significantly outperform low activity traders.

📊 Evidence — Risk Segment Performance

Position Size / Leverage Proxy:

Average trade size increases during Fear sentiment.

High-risk traders generate highest profits during Fear.

Low-risk traders perform relatively better during Greed.

Directional Bias

Slight increase in long bias during Fear sentiment.

No extreme directional skew observed.

Interpretation:

Fear sentiment triggers aggressive behaviour:

Higher trade frequency

Larger trade sizes

Increased risk exposure

Greed sentiment leads to:

Reduced trade size

Lower participation

Slightly higher win rate but lower PnL

Q3. Identify 2–3 Trader Segments
Segment 1 — High Activity vs Low Activity Traders

High Activity Traders:

Significantly higher PnL across all regimes

Most profitable during Fear

Low Activity Traders:

Stable but lower returns

Less sentiment-sensitive

Segment 2 — High Risk vs Low Risk Traders

High Risk Traders:

Highest profitability during Fear

Higher volatility in returns

Low Risk Traders:

More stable returns

Perform relatively better during Greed

Segment 3 — Consistent vs Inconsistent Traders

Consistency measured using standard deviation of daily win rate.

Consistent Traders:

Stable performance patterns

Lower volatility in returns

Inconsistent Traders:

Larger profit swings

Higher sensitivity to sentiment shifts

🔍 Key Insights

Trader profitability is highest during Fear sentiment periods.

High activity traders consistently outperform low activity traders.

Risk-taking behaviour increases during Fear and drives higher returns.

Trade size has stronger impact on profitability than win rate accuracy.

Sentiment impacts behaviour more than accuracy.

PART C — Actionable Strategy Recommendations
Strategy 1 — Fear Market Volatility Strategy

Rule:
Increase trade participation and moderately increase trade size during Fear sentiment for high-activity and high-risk traders.

Rationale:
Fear periods historically produce the highest trader profitability due to volatility expansion.

Strategy 2 — Greed Market Risk Moderation Strategy

Rule:
Reduce average trade size and apply stricter risk control during Greed sentiment, especially for high-risk traders.

Rationale:
Greed periods show lower overall profitability and may encourage overconfidence-driven inefficiencies.

Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that market sentiment significantly influences trader behaviour and performance. Fear-driven volatility provides higher profit opportunities, particularly for high activity and high risk traders. Incorporating sentiment-aware strategies can improve both profitability and risk management.
